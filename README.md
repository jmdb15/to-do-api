Regarding the code in tasks/views.py, I'm not sure if what I did is correct but in my defense, the application works perfectly fine since I used DRF's viewset. I utilized its built-in methods to minimize my work but still complete the task given to me. 

I enjoyed taking this exam and I'm looking forward to your response and to be a part of your team! Thank you.
